git init: it it used to create a new repo for the local folder and push to github
git remote add orgin "link" : this command is used to set a remote area for pushing our code

Branches: When thier is 2 or more developer working on the same project then all the developers make thier thier seperate brancehs to work on differnet part like frontend backend and database and at the end they merge thier brancehs with the main branch
commands->
git branch: to check the branch
git branch -M main: to rename the branch name to main
