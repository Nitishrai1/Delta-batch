    <!-- API (Application programming interface just like a waiter tyey take a request and give it to api which bring back the result from the user and giev it to the user  API give the data in the form of JSON generally) -->

    <!-- JSON java script object notation it is a format of the data which is can be used in any lanaguege no matter what the programing language in past xml was used in plcae JSON file in jason the value id stored in the fomat of the key value pair in the form of string in JSON thier is no undefined data JSON validator is used to validata the JSON that the JSon is valid or not -->

    <!-- HOW to acces JSON data: Whenever the JSON come it come in the format of string JSON.parse(data) it is used to parse the JSON data into the javascript object wheread JSON.stringfy(data) is used to convert the object data into the for of string-->

    <script>

        let json='{"fact":"Cats don\u2019t have sweat glands over their bodies like humans do. Instead, they sweat only through their paws.","length":107}'

        let obj=JSON.parse(json);
        console.log(obj);

        let json2=JSON.stringify(obj);
        console.log(json2);  //this will convert the object data into the format of the json

        // Testing API request
        // there ar two tool Hoppscoth and Postman which is used to test the API 


        // AJAX asynchronus Javascript and xml it is ued when ever we request to the server the process is performend in the asynchronus manner because the page do not reload whenever a api take time then the next task is  performend and when the api request is perfomend then the page show the result

        // HTTP verbs
        // get request:it is used whenever we want toget some request form the server 
        // post request: it is used when we wan to post somme data
        // delete : it is used when ever we want to delete

        // Status code
        // 200 ok
        // 404 whenever we call the api which do not exit then status 404 error comes
        // 400 bad request
        // 500 internal server error
        // client side error start form 400 and server end error start form 500 

        // Add information on API

        // url consist of deffernt part in which there is a q represent the key and after = represent the value
        // eg: https//www.google.com/search?q=harry.potter

        // we can send the specifuc id for the data which we want in the url of the api

        // HTTP header: we can also send the http header with the api url header can be used in different way and can extra data to the url that which type of data i want text type or json type etc.

        // Creating the first API request
        let url="https://catfact.ninja/fact";
        //this funciton return a promise

        fetch(url)
            .then((res)=>{
                console.log(res);
                return res.json(); //this will also return a promise which give the data in readble data format
            })
            .then((data)=>{
                console.log("data1 = ",data.fact);
                return fetch(url);
            })
            .then((res)=>{
                return res.json();
            })
            .then((data2)=>{
                console.log("data2 = ",data2.fact);
            })
            .catch((err)=>{
                console.log("ERROR - ",err);
            })
